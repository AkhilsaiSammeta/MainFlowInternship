# Student Management System

## Overview

The Student Management System is a SQL-based project designed to manage and analyze student performance data. This project provides practical experience in SQL database creation, data manipulation, and analysis.

## Objectives

- Create a database to store student information.
- Populate the database with sample student records.
- Perform various data analysis tasks to gain insights into student performance.

## Database Setup

1. **Create Database**: `StudentManagement`

2. **Create Table**: `Students`

   - **Fields**:
     - `StudentID`: INT, Primary Key, Auto-increment
     - `Name`: VARCHAR(50)
     - `Gender`: VARCHAR(1) ('M' for Male, 'F' for Female)
     - `Age`: INT
     - `Grade`: VARCHAR(10)
     - `MathScore`: INT
     - `ScienceScore`: INT
     - `EnglishScore`: INT

## Sample Data

Inserted 10 diverse student records with varying names, genders, grades, and scores in Math, Science, and English.

## Key SQL Queries

1. **Display All Students**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Students;
   ```

2. **Calculate Average Scores**:

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(MathScore) AS AverageMathScore, AVG(ScienceScore) AS AverageScienceScore, AVG(EnglishScore) AS AverageEnglishScore 
   FROM Students;
   ```

3. **Identify Top Performer**:

   ```sql
   SELECT Name, (MathScore + ScienceScore + EnglishScore) AS TotalScore 
   FROM Students 
   ORDER BY TotalScore DESC 
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

4. **Count Students by Grade**:

   ```sql
   SELECT Grade, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfStudents 
   FROM Students 
   GROUP BY Grade;
   ```

5. **Average Scores by Gender**:

   ```sql
   SELECT Gender, AVG(MathScore) AS AverageMathScore, AVG(ScienceScore) AS AverageScienceScore, AVG(EnglishScore) AS AverageEnglishScore 
   FROM Students 
   GROUP BY Gender;
   ```

6. **High Achievers in Math**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Students 
   WHERE MathScore > 80;
   ```

7. **Update Student Grade**:

   ```sql
   UPDATE Students 
   SET Grade = 'A' 
   WHERE StudentID = 5;  -- Replace 5 with the specific Student ID
   ```

## Insights Gained

- Enhanced skills in SQL operations, including table creation, data insertion, and querying.
- Learned to perform data aggregation and filtering effectively.
- Understood the importance of maintaining accurate and up-to-date records in a database.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable hands-on experience with SQL and data management, preparing me for future challenges in database development and analysis.
